          <span>
          Currently a student at Heriot-Watt University, I'm exploring front-end development. Using ReactJS, Sass, and Chakra UI, I experiment with dynamic and visually pleasing interfaces. React's component-based structure aids in modular application development, while Sass adds styling flexibility. Chakra UI ensures design consistency. As I navigate my studies at HWU, I aim to stay updated on web development trends, integrating tools to simplify workflows and create user-friendly applications with attention to both aesthetics and functionality.
